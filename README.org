First, I want to say, I am a bad English writor, but there are many good English readers, and for them, bad is better than nothing.

** Open Code
   Open code in an editor(sublime or emacs) in REPL.

   Sometimes, when we write code, we want to see the source. So I think, it is helpful if we have such function.

   It will try to find an editor by the `EDITOR` environment variable, if the `EDITOR` is not setted, it will use Emacs.

*** Usage
    1. `@op JSON` will open the JSON pakcage in an editor.
    2. `of(string)` will open the string function in an editor. And you can use it by `of(string,2)` will open the second method(In REPL, when you type `string`, it will show many methods, and this will open the second one).

*** Support
    It is just support sublime and emacs in Mac. And if the editor is sublime, it will open the method's file, and cursor will be on the line of the method.
